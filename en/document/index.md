- I could not update the documentation in time because I have been writing the project
- Please refer to the examples for energy use, many examples are provided in the source code
- Refer to the documentation links provided below for use of the CEF API.
- If any problems encountered in the use of energy, can add [QQ Group](/en/about/contact)
  At the same time, we look forward to your joining, growing together, and continuing to maintain this project better
